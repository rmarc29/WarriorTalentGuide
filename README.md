# WarriorTalentGuide
## Info
This is an AddOn for World of Warcraft Vanilla (v.1.12), that will show warrior players what talent to choose.
Based on wowhead's hardcored warrior guide : https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/warrior/hardcore-leveling-tips

## Future
I'll try to create all the other classes guides soon enough, I'll link everything down here :
[Hunter Guide](https://github.com/rmarc29/HunterTalentGuide)

At the end my project is to try to create a single AddOn that will track which class you play so you won't have to constantly switch between them.
